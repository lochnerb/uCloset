            We are BL Consulting (BL Co) -a small company with one simple goal: delivering an excellent product to our 
            customers!
            <br /><br />
            Based in Arlington Virginia, Lochner Consulting creates websites, web applications, and assesses the 
            client needs to create innovative solutions for maximum results!
            <br /><br />
            The idea for ucloset.net was born when the lead developer’s girlfriend realized his complete lack 
            of ability for putting together outfits! Further brainstorming and creative process led to the ability 
            for all to categorize their clothing and share cool outfits with friends, family, and girlfriends! 
            The Lochner Consulting Team hopes that you find uCloset to be a fun tool to maximize time in the closet 
            and dress to impress!
